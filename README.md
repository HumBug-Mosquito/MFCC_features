# MFCC_fine
Code and Documentation for extracting MFCC features the finely-labelled dataset hosted on Humbug.ac.uk 

Please read Documentation/ first, then mfcc_fine/
Example code (not verified by others) for mfcc_weak/ (from the coarsely labelled dataset) are also included in mfcc_weak/ with an example with a few Culex audio files in mfcc_weak - Culex/ 
The weak Culex example may be a good reference for mfcc_fine, in terms of the finished folder structure
The procedure will require access to Humbug.ac.uk to download data from database before feature extraction. 
If you have any questions, please email Lawrence - lawrence1994@gmail.com
